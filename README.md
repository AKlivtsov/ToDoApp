# REST-full api of ToDo app

Well, basicaly it's tiny server(Flask+sqlalchemy) and web client(reflex), aaand.. nothing more.

# how to start it?
## server
 1. create venv with python 3.13 (i use pyenv to do it, so do you)
 2. install requirements.txt
 3. create .env file with DATABASE_URL (use any db as you like)
 4. run app.py
 5. enjoy
## web client
 1. Idk, i can't remember how to do it. Tryna fix it as soon as posible)

# What's next?
 1. Re-write server on FastAPI (I don't want to write api documentation. So, yep, i choose FastAPI)
 2. Fix webClient. (maybe re-write it)
 3. !!!MAYBE!!! Make sick-ass web and server apps, that conqure all of this segment of these apps. (ha-ha)
