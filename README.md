*just a donut!*

## how to start it?
- server (source code) 
  1. create venv with python 3.13 (i use pyenv to do it, so do you)
  2. install requirements.txt
  3. create .env file with DATABASE_URL (use any db as you like)
  4. run app.py
  5. enjoy

- server (docker)
  1. There's no one yet. Yep. Working on it.

- client
  1. Again. There is no client. DO IT YOURSELF WITH POSTMAN, MAN

## Currently in work!:
 1. FastAPI migration + refactoring

## What's next?
 1. Re-write server on FastAPI (Flask server will be deleted)
 2. Create clients for telegram via reflex-the-web-framework (just Reflex)

## ROAD TO ITMO
1. Fuck it, make social network with users and task 
2. There's gonna be telegram mini apps/bot, web, standalone clients (+ self hosted server)
3. There's gonna be two types of tasks: private (only user can see it) and public (all users can see it on a person's profile)
