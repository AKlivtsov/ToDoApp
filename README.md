# REST-full api of ToDo app

Well, basicaly it's social network with users and tasks. Simply lovely, huh?

# how to start it?
## server (source code) 
 1. create venv with python 3.13 (i use pyenv to do it, so do you)
 2. install requirements.txt
 3. create .env file with DATABASE_URL (use any db as you like)
 4. run app.py
 5. enjoy

## server (docker)
 1. There's no one yet. Yep. Working on it.

## client
 1. Again. There is no client. DO IT YOURSELF WITH POSTMAN, MAN

# Currently in work!:
 1. FastAPI migration + refactoring

# What's next?
 1. Re-write server on FastAPI (Flask server will be deleted)
 2. Create clients for telegram via reflex-the-web-framework (just Reflex)

# ROAD TO ITMO
    1. Fuck it, make social network with users and task 
    2. There's gonna be telegram mini apps/bot, web, standalone clients (+ self hosted server)
    3. There's gonna be two types of tasks: private (only user can see it) and public (all users can see it on a person's profile)
